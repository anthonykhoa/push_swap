WORK IN PROGRESS

This project is about sorting integers on a stack. The project gives you only two stacks to work with, stacks A and B.
Stack A will be filled with a list of integers. The goal of the project is to sort the itegers in stack A into ascending order,
using only stacks A and B;
The algorithm i'm currently thinking of attempts to do this in Onlogn instructions.
Take a look at the project PDF for more details on the project!
